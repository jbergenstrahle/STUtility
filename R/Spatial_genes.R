#' Find genes with high spatial autocorrelation
#'
#' This function can be used to find genes with spatial structure in ST datasets.
#' A more detailed decription of the algorithm is outlined in the Details section below.
#'
#' overview of method:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item{Build a connection network from the array x,y coordinates for each sample. For a 'Visium' array, this would typically be 6 neighbours
#'    because of the hexagonal structure of spots.}
#'    \item{Combine connection networks from multiple samples}
#'    \item{Compute the lag vector for each feature}
#'    \item{Compute the correlation between the lag vector and the original vector}
#' }
#' The connection network is build by defining edges between each spot and its `nNeighborurs` closest
#' neighbours that are within a maximum distance defined by `maxdist`. This is to make sure that spots
#' along the tissue edges or holes have the correct number of neighbours. A connection network is built for
#' each section separately but they are then combined into one large connection network so that the
#' autocorrelation can be computed for the whole dataset.
#'
#' Now that we have a neighbour group defined for
#' each spot, we can calculate the lag vector for each feature. The lag vector of a features is essentially
#' the summed expression of that feature in the neighbour groups, computed for all spots and can be thought
#' of as a "smoothing" estimate.
#'
#' If we consider a spot A and its neighbours nbA, a feature with high spatial
#' corelation should have similar expression levels in both groups. We can therefore compute the a
#' correlation score between the lag vector and the "normal" expression vector to get an estimate of
#' the spatial autocorrelation.
#'
#' @param object Seurat object
#' @param assay Name of assay the function is being run on
#' @param slot Slot to use as input [default: 'scale.data']
#' @param features Features to rank by spatial autocorrelation. If no features are provided, the
#' features are selected using the `VariableFeatures` function in Seurat, meaning that the top variable genes
#' will be used.
#' @param nNeighbours Number of neighbours to find for each spot, For Visium data, this parameter is set to
#' 6 because of the spots are arranged in a hexagonal pattern and should have maximum 6 neighbors.
#' @param maxdist Maximum allowed distance to define neighbouring spots [default: 1.5]. If not provided, a
#' maximum distance is automatically selected depending on the platform. For Visium data, this maximum distance
#' is set to 150 microns.
